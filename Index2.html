  <h1>Why you should focus <br>
    and how you've wasted your life</h1>
  <h4><em>by yourself</em></h4>

  <p>
    Let's be honest, you have always known what you needed to do, what you <strong>had</strong> to do. <br>
    but instead you've convinced yourself with the idea that you needed to know more and that there was a magic formula for the things you wanted <br>
    you have wasted endless hours searching for information on how to do something instead of doing that something, you are a <strong>master procrastinator</strong>.
    The worst part is that you already knew it.
